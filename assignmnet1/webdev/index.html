	 				<p>Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts â€“ the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens.  <br>The Shinobi World is marked by the division of five great Shinobi countries: powerful nations who became as much via their military powers. Wars are occasionally fought between these five great powers but the world has no conventional weapons of war, as we would understand them. Instead battles are fought between ninjas, who are trained from a young age to harness their life force (or "chakra") to create attacks and illusions.</p>
	 			<hr>

	 				<p>The five nations are split along geographic and elemental lines, as each nation has an elemental flavor to the types of ninjutsu skills their warriors can recreate. The countries are the Land of Earth, the Land of Lightning, the Land of Wind, the Land of Water and the Land of Fire. All of their warriors are trained in hidden villages built around the training academies where young soldiers-to-be learn to control their powers.</p>
